# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

1. I am undertaking a degree in **Computer Science**
   - I am taking *STATS 220* because I would like to know how data is stored through technology.
* I am interested in learning about different types of graphs that show different relationships between two variables.
